# 🧠 Resume-Based Course Recommender System

This is a **Django-based web application** that intelligently recommends Udemy courses by analyzing the contents of your uploaded resume. It utilizes **NLP embeddings** to match your resume to relevant course titles.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📄 Upload a resume (`PDF` or `TXT`)
- 📚 Upload a dataset of Udemy courses (`CSV`)
- 🤖 Auto-recommend top-N most relevant courses
- ⚡ Fast, accurate semantic matching via `sentence-transformers`
- 🔍 Uses cosine similarity between embeddings for recommendation

| Layer        | Tech Used                                     |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Backend      | Django, Python                                |
| NLP Model    | `sentence-transformers` (`distilbert-base-nli-mean-tokens`) |
| Data Format  | Custom `udemy_courses.csv` (title, link, price) |
| PDF Parsing  | `pdfplumber`                                  |
| Embeddings   | PyTorch tensor embeddings                     |
| Similarity   | Cosine similarity for ranking                 |

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Resume Upload**: User uploads a resume in `.pdf` or `.txt` format.

2. **Text Extraction**: Resume is parsed to extract raw text using `pdfplumber`.

3. **Embedding Generation**:
   - Resume text is embedded using `sentence-transformers`.
   - Course titles from CSV are also embedded.

4. **Similarity Comparison**: Cosine similarity scores are calculated.

5. **Recommendation Output**: Top-N matching courses are displayed based on similarity scores.

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. **Install dependencies**
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Run migrations**
python manage.py migrate

5. **Start development server**
python manage.py runserver

---

## 📦 Requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt

Key packages:
- Django
- pdfplumber
- sentence-transformers
- torch
- pandas

---

## 📖 Usage

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
2. Upload your resume (PDF/TXT format)
3. Upload Udemy courses dataset (CSV format)
4. Click "Get Recommendations"
5. View your personalized course suggestions!

---

## 📋 Dataset Format

Your Udemy courses CSV should have these columns:
title,link,price
"Python for Data Science","https://udemy.com/course/...",49.99
"Web Development Bootcamp","https://udemy.com/course/...",89.99
